**README: Text-to-Speech Using Bark Library**

**Introduction:**
This Python script showcases the usage of the Bark library for text-to-speech synthesis. Bark is a library for generating high-quality, natural-sounding speech. The script uses the library to generate audio from a provided text prompt and plays the audio using IPython's Audio widget.

**Dependencies:**
- bark: A text-to-speech synthesis library for Python.
- torch: The PyTorch library is required, and it should be version 1.2 or higher for improved performance.
- IPython: Used for displaying audio within the Colab Notebook environment.

**Setup:**
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git
   ```
2. Ensure that PyTorch is installed, and it is version 1.2 or higher.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook environment or in a Google Colab or in any notebok or a Python script: `python your_script_name.py`.
2. The script installs the Bark library and preloads necessary models.
3. It provides a text prompt that serves as input for the text-to-speech synthesis.
4. The Bark library generates an audio array based on the text prompt.
5. The IPython Audio widget is used to play the generated audio within the Colab Notebook.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure that your environment has a compatible version of PyTorch (>=1.2) for optimal performance.
- The provided `text_prompt` variable contains an example text; you can modify it to generate audio for different texts.
- The Bark library supports multiple voices and configurations; refer to the documentation for customization options.
- The audio is played directly in the Colab Notebook using the IPython Audio widget.

**Additional Information:**
- For more details on the Bark library and its capabilities, refer to the official repository: [Bark GitHub Repository](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark).
- Explore the Bark library documentation for customization options and advanced usage.
